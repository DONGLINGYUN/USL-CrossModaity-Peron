# USL-CrossModaity-Peron
We introduced a semi-supervised learning method in cross-modal person re-identification, whose main purpose is to generate high-quality cross-modal image pairs guided by confidence scores based on supervised information, and update the memory bank. By using the interaction between features of different modalities, the model achieves the effect of reducing modal differences. Our model mainly includes two modules: Confidence Guided cross-modality pseudo-label generation and semi-supervised cross-modalality discriminative feature learning. A large number of experiments have proved its effectiveness.
